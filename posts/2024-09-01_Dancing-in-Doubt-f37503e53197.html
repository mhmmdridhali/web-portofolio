Just a heavy silence that made him feel small, insignificant.</p><p name="99df" id="99df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The presence was close, like a shadow clinging to him, refusing to let go.</p><p name="9bad" id="9bad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">&quot;Why are you here?&quot;</em> he whispered, looking at the empty chair across from him, feeling as though something—or someone—was sitting there, watching him.</p><p name="19e4" id="19e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was no reply, but he could feel the answer deep in his bones.

It didn’t need to speak. Its presence was enough to fill his mind with doubts. Every time he tried to focus, to push forward, he started to question himself.</p><blockquote name="a652" id="a652" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What if I fail?”</blockquote><blockquote name="a98c" id="a98c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“What if I’m not good enough?”</blockquote><blockquote name="e474" id="e474" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“What if I’m just wasting my time?”</blockquote><p name="4c73" id="4c73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The questions kept coming, digging into him, making him second-guess every move, every choice.

For him, it wasn’t just an occasional worry; it was a constant presence, a weight that pressed down on him every moment of the day.</p><p name="7a7f" id="7a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine feeling trapped, as if invisible bars surrounded you, keeping you from moving freely.</p><p name="a4e1" id="a4e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s how he felt—like failure had imprisoned him, restricting his every move. Even during simple moments, like sitting down for a meal, the weight of failure sat across from him, making it impossible to find peace. When he tried to gather his courage and face the challenges of life, failure was there, mocking his efforts, making his hands tremble with doubt.</p><blockquote name="2897" id="2897" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Failure is terrifying, especially when all I want is to keep trying to be human.”</blockquote><p name="03a6" id="03a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Until Next Time, See Ya!</em></p></div></div></section>
