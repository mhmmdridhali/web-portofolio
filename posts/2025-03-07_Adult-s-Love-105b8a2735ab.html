As Genuine as the One We Had in Youth?

Is it as genuine as when we were young?</blockquote><figure name="4fd2" id="4fd2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*foepCS5xQe1R5bFoNVn-6A.jpeg" data-width="716" data-height="536" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*foepCS5xQe1R5bFoNVn-6A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: &quot;TOGETHER&quot; Original Graphite Drawing by Hannah Harel</figcaption></figure><p name="fb52" id="fb52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Love is one of the most profound experiences in life, yet it evolves as we grow older. When we were young, love felt like a whirlwind—passionate, exhilarating, and often consuming. It was easy to get lost in the emotions, to believe in fairy tales, and to think that love alone could conquer anything.</p><p name="873c" id="873c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But as adults, we see love through a different lens. It is no longer just about fleeting emotions; it’s about choices, responsibilities, and shared values. Some argue that this version of love is less pure, less magical, and more calculated.</p><p name="7d23" id="7d23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">But is that really true? Does love change, or do we simply understand it better?</em></p><h3 name="6726" id="6726" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Fiery and Reckless Love of Youth</h3><p name="7729" id="7729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Young love is often described as an explosion—sudden, intense, and impossible to ignore. It’s the kind of love that makes your heart race with excitement, where every text message feels like the highlight of your day, and every little gesture feels like a sign from the universe.</p><p name="d84f" id="d84f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At that stage, love is mostly about emotions. There are no deep worries about responsibilities, no heavy discussions about finances or long-term commitments. The only thing that matters is how the other person makes you feel. It’s easy to believe in forever when nothing stands in the way, when love is all about the highs and rarely about the lows.</p><p name="169f" id="169f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, the intensity of young love can also make it fragile. Since it is built largely on emotions, it may struggle when reality starts knocking—when distance, personal growth, or life’s inevitable challenges put it to the test. And sometimes, what felt like love was just the thrill of something new.</p><blockquote name="093e" id="093e" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">&quot;They say love is blind, but young love is also deaf, impulsive, and slightly delusional.&quot;</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="1f96" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="6b8c" id="6b8c" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Deep and Steady Love of Adulthood</h3><p name="5668" id="5668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If young love is like a soda explosion—fizzy, exciting, but quick to fade—then adult love is like a warm blanket on a rainy day. It may not be as dramatic, but it is steady, comforting, and built to last.</p><p name="1c5d" id="1c5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As adults, love is no longer just about how someone makes us feel; it’s about who they are and how they treat us. It’s about building a life together, growing side by side, and choosing each other despite life’s imperfections. Love in adulthood is not just about finding someone to dream with, but about finding someone to face reality with.</p><p name="fa53" id="fa53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">While young love might be defined by passion, adult love is defined by patience, understanding, and resilience. It acknowledges flaws, navigates challenges, and prioritizes emotional security over fleeting excitement. It is love with depth—one that doesn’t just spark joy but also provides a place to rest, heal, and grow.</p></div></div></section><section name="b079" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="e72d" id="e72d" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Key Differences Between Young and Adult Love</h3><p name="705a" id="705a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The biggest difference between love in youth and love in adulthood is the balance between emotion and responsibility. Young love is like a storm—powerful but unpredictable. It thrives on passion but may struggle when faced with real-life hardships. Adult love, on the other hand, is like a well-built house—strong enough to withstand storms because it was built with care, patience, and commitment.</p><blockquote name="d384" id="d384" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It may not give you butterflies every day, but it gives you a hand to hold when the butterflies are gone.&quot;</blockquote><p name="dee7" id="dee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Another major difference is the role of choice. Young love often feels involuntary, like something that just happens. In contrast, adult love is a conscious decision. It is about choosing to stay, to compromise, and to grow together. It is no longer just about how love makes you feel but about how you sustain it.</p><p name="ccda" id="ccda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This doesn’t mean that one is better than the other. Both are genuine, but they serve different purposes in our journey. Young love teaches us about emotions, passion, and heartbreak. Adult love teaches us about endurance, depth, and unconditional commitment.</p></div></div></section><section name="2665" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="c280" id="c280" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading">So, Is Adult Love Still as Genuine?</blockquote><p name="ac35" id="ac35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Some people argue that love in adulthood loses its purity because it involves practical considerations—career, finances, long-term compatibility. But does responsibility make love less real? If anything, true love always comes with responsibility. It is not just about feeling something in the moment; it is about choosing to care, to give, and to stay.</p><p name="96dd" id="96dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think of a mother’s love for her child. It is one of the purest forms of love, yet it is not based on emotions alone. A mother gives, nurtures, sacrifices—not because she feels butterflies in her stomach every day, but because love is more than a feeling; it is a commitment. In the same way, adult love is genuine not because it is effortless, but because it chooses to endure.</p><p name="f70f" id="f70f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, yes, adult love is still as real, as true, and maybe even purer. While young love is about how someone makes you feel, adult love is about who they are, how they treat you, and how you both grow together. It may be less dreamy, but it is more meaningful.</p><blockquote name="293c" id="293c" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">&quot;Maybe love doesn’t change with age. Maybe we just learn what love truly means.&quot;</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="f6e0" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="7852" id="7852" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">In the end, love isn’t about chasing an idealized version of romance. It is about embracing the reality of two imperfect people choosing to stay together despite everything.</p><blockquote name="a80b" id="a80b" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">&quot;I don’t deserve someone’s perfect because I realize that I’m not perfect either.&quot;</blockquote><p name="bbe3" id="bbe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">And that, perhaps, is the most genuine love of all.</em></p></div></div></section>
