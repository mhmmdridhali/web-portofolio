And if the outcome is already known, what’s the point of hoping, praying, or dreaming? It’s a thought that confuses the edges of our understanding about free will, fate, and the divine.</p></div></div></section><section name="82ec" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="9018" id="9018" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Luh Al-Mahfuz</h3><p name="c188" id="c188" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Luh Al-Mahfuz is a term in Islam referring to the concept of a tablet or record where all events in the world have been written, from major occurrences to the smallest details. Literally, the term Luh Al-Mahfuz comes from the Arabic words <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Luh</em>, which means a broad surface suitable for writing, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Mahfuz</em>, which means preserved.</p><p name="c21d" id="c21d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thus, the term can be interpreted as a preserved record, where everything written within it will neither change nor be corrupted.</p><blockquote name="6f27" id="6f27" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain in the darkness of the earth and no moist or dry thing but that it is [written] in a clear record.” (Q.S. Al-An’am 6:59)</blockquote><p name="3ff9" id="3ff9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Interestingly, mystics outside Islam have their interpretations of a similar concept. Western esotericism refers to it as the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Akashic Records</em>, which translates to “sky records.”</p><p name="21e4" id="21e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rooted in metaphysical traditions, this idea suggests a cosmic library documenting every action, thought, and event in the universe— whether they have happened in the past, are happening in the present, or will happen in the future.</p><p name="df19" id="df19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In more modern perspectives, Luh Al-Mahfuz is sometimes referred to as the “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">universal server</em>,” a term used by some to explain this concept in modern language — using analogies that are easier for the general public to understand.</p><p name="63d9" id="63d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">However, Luh Al-Mahfuz is certainly far more complex and meaningful than the term “universal server.”</em></p><h3 name="3898" id="3898" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Essence of Luh Al-Mahfuz</h3><p name="3e33" id="3e33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When we say that everything is written in Luh Al-Mahfuz, it truly means <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">everything</em>. This includes the branches of life paths that could have happened if someone made certain choices, but didn’t happen because they chose differently.</p><p name="ce5a" id="ce5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For instance, suppose You are offered coffee and tea, each with its reward. Let’s say coffee leads to receiving shoes, and tea leads to receiving clothes. Your choice is up to you, but the outcomes for both options are already written. When you choose tea, you activate the path leading to clothes, while the path leading to shoes remains a possibility that never materializes.</p><p name="49ae" id="49ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the essence of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Man proposes, God disposes.”</em> Your choices are part of the plan, yet their outcomes have already been determined. Whether a decision is made or not, every possibility exists in Luh Al-Mahfuz.</p><p name="dbac" id="dbac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every possibility already exists in Luh Al-Mahfuz, whether it will happen, has happened, or will never happen.</p><p name="2cef" id="2cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">All activities of human life are already written by God from A to Z, along with the many branches of possibilities and choices humans can make. If you choose A, the result is destiny A. Choices B and destiny B, along with the rest, are eliminated even though they are also recorded in Luh Al-Mahfuz.</p></div></div></section><section name="f2a2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="21cf" id="21cf" class="graf graf--h3 graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf--leading">‘As You<strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong"> </strong>Wish’</h3><p name="b310" id="b310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Wishing and praying are not attempts to rewrite destiny but acts of faith and connection. They acknowledge our dependence on Allah and reflect our hopes. Within the grand tapestry of destiny, they remind us that while Allah’s knowledge is absolute, our journey is still deeply personal.</p><p name="c2e9" id="c2e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luh Al-Mahfuz is a reminder of Allah’s omniscience and mercy. It shows us that every possibility is known to Him, and yet, He grants us the freedom to choose. This divine record is not meant to limit us but to guide us in trusting His greater plan.</p><p name="cc02" id="cc02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we navigate life’s choices, let us remember that our wishes, prayers, and efforts are all meaningful parts of this journey. They reflect our sincerity, humility, and reliance on Allah’s wisdom.</p><p name="7a8d" id="7a8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then,</p><p name="b147" id="b147" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“If everything is already written in Luh Al-Mahfuz, then why should we wish?”</em></p><p name="a2b3" id="a2b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Maybe, on some pages, Allah has written, ‘<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">As you wish’.</em></p></div></div></section>
