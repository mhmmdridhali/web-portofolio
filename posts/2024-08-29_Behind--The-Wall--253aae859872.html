What if the walls around us could share the secrets they’ve quietly observed over the years?</p></div></div></section><section name="2e27" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="f976" id="f976" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Wall That Knows It All</h3><p name="8bde" id="8bde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Hey, are you busy? Mind giving me a few minutes? First off, let me introduce myself. I’m just a wall. Yep, just the wall in the room of the eldest child. I don’t have a name, so feel free to call me “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Wall</strong>.” It’s a fact, and well, that’s what I am.</p><p name="665a" id="665a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But this isn’t really about me. So, let’s skip the part where I talk about myself, which would be pretty boring anyway.</p></div></div></section><section name="2309" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="7ac4" id="7ac4" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Eldest and the Mask They Wear</h3><p name="5602" id="5602" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This is about the Eldest. Every day, I’m here, watching. I’ve probably seen more of their laughter and tears than anyone else. Not to brag, but that’s just how it is. There’s so much about the Eldest that no one knows.</p><p name="3c70" id="3c70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At night, when the world is silent and everyone’s slipping into dreamland, the Eldest is still wide awake. Leaning on me, eyes wandering to the ceiling or door, as if hoping for some kind of answer to the chaos inside their head.</p><p name="ed62" id="ed62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not that the Eldest overthinks everything. No, their mind is always fixated on one thing: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how to appear strong and invincible</em>. It’s not arrogance, and they’re not fishing for compliments either. They just can’t stand the idea of looking weak.</p><blockquote name="bc09" id="bc09" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">&quot;The strongest people make time to help others, even if they’re struggling with their own problems.&quot;</blockquote><p name="8eb9" id="8eb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">There aren’t many people who can hear the fears running through his mind or feel the anxiety coiling in his heart like thorns. Truth is, the Eldest doesn’t really know how to share those feelings. Because to him, sharing would be the same as showing vulnerability.</p></div></div></section><section name="f571" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a834" id="a834" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Weight Behind the Armor</h3><p name="2231" id="2231" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">On the outside, the Eldest seems cold and tough, like their heart is stone and their body made of steel. But trust me, it’s all just a mask and armor.</p><p name="6845" id="6845" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That blank face, the suit of armor, it’s just their battle gear to face the brutal world. The Eldest wears it to protect themselves because, in their mind, not being strong means being a failure. That’s the monster that haunts them every single night.</p><h3 name="c05d" id="c05d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Simple Dream, a Heavy Crown</h3><p name="6761" id="6761" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I know their dreams too. They’re not grand or over the top. All they want is to be a source of happiness, to be the child and sibling that everyone can be proud of and rely on. Because they think that’s their job. That’s why they cling to this image of being “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the strongest</strong>.”</p><blockquote name="4d05" id="4d05" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">&quot;We rise by lifting others.&quot; — Robert Ingersoll</blockquote></div></div></section><section name="410a" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5150" id="5150" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">That’s the story I have to share about the Eldest. But before I end, there’s something important I want you to know. If you, too, are the eldest, carrying the weight of expectations, remember this: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">it’s okay to let down your guard sometimes. It’s okay to be vulnerable, to feel tired, and to not have all the answers</em>.</p><blockquote name="c3a9" id="c3a9" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">&quot;Even the strongest walls have cracks, but those cracks are what let the light in.&quot;</blockquote><p name="b1eb" id="b1eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">You don’t always have to be the strongest for everyone else. You are allowed to lean on others, to rest, and to let someone see the real you behind the armor. And if, in those quiet moments, you find yourself alone with your thoughts, know that even the walls around you understand. They’ve been here all along, holding your secrets, sharing your burdens in silence.</p><p name="978f" id="978f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">So, take a deep breath. You’re not as alone as you think.</em></p></div></div></section>
