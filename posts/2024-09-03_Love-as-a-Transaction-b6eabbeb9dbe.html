We speak of love in its many forms, from romantic to familial.</p><p name="41cd" id="41cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But can we, as flawed and limited beings, love without conditions? Or is what we call &quot;love&quot; simply an emotional transaction, bound by the expectations and needs of both parties?</p></div></div></section><section name="a818" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3f92" id="3f92" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">The Nature of Human Love</h3><p name="7ee7" id="7ee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s a difficult truth to accept, but human love is rarely without conditions. We are drawn to others for reasons—whether it’s their beauty, kindness, intellect, or wealth. Even the most basic relationships have an element of give and take, an exchange of emotions or services.</p><p name="5466" id="5466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Would you love your husband if he stopped working hard, if he no longer provided for the family or made you happy? Would you continue to love your wife if she consistently disrespected you or neglected your needs? As humans, our love often depends on what we receive in return.</p><blockquote name="a701" id="a701" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">&quot;The deeds are but by intentions, and every person will only get what they intended.&quot; (Sahih al-Bukhari).</blockquote><p name="3518" id="3518" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Humans, often struggle to love beyond the parameters of reciprocity. It’s a reflection of our limitations. As the saying goes in Arabic, &quot;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Al-hubb yubna ‘ala asbab</em>&quot; (Love is built upon reasons). These reasons, whether we acknowledge them or not, often determine the strength of our relationship.</p><h3 name="373c" id="373c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The True Love Unconditionally</h3><p name="9587" id="9587" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In contrast, Allah’s love for us is without limits. He does not love us for what we can give Him, nor does He demand our perfection. His love is ever-present, whether we are wealthy or poor, young or old, healthy or ill.</p><p name="11f4" id="11f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The saint <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rabia Basri</em> coined the term &quot;<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ishq</em></strong>&quot; to describe the highest, most intense form of love—a love reserved for the Divine, far beyond human comprehension. This is the kind of love that transcends all worldly conditions, existing purely in the realm of the spiritual.</p><p name="30c8" id="30c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Allah’s love for us remains unchanged regardless of our actions, status, or external appearance. He loves us when we are wealthy, and He loves us when we are poor. He loves us in our youth, and He continues to love us in our old age. His love is not contingent on what we do, but on who He is—infinitely merciful.</p><blockquote name="0ab6" id="0ab6" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“<em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">Say, &#39;O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’&quot;</em> (Q.S. Az- Zumar:53)</blockquote><p name="6812" id="6812" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Allah loves us despite our flaws, and His love endures regardless of our actions. He is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Al-Ghafoor</em> (The Forgiving) and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ar-Rahman</em> (The Most Merciful). No matter how far we stray, we only need to ask for His forgiveness, and He will welcome us back with open arms.</p><p name="efaa" id="efaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This is a kind of love that no human can offer—unconditional, boundless, and rooted in mercy.</em></p><h3 name="768a" id="768a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Key to Human Relationships</h3><blockquote name="9839" id="9839" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3">Since we, as humans, are incapable of loving in this divine way, what, then, keeps our relationships sustain?</blockquote><p name="49a5" id="49a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The answer lies in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">mercy</em>. Mercy is what allows us to forgive the flaws and shortcomings of others. It is what enables us to look past our differences and continue to support one another, even when things get difficult.</p><p name="c14e" id="c14e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marriage, friendship, and even familial love are not sustained by the fleeting emotions we often associate with love. They endure through the practice of mercy, rights, responsibilities, and forgiveness. A husband may not always be able to provide, a wife may not always be gentle, but mercy allows for grace in moments of weakness.</p><blockquote name="3a71" id="3a71" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">&quot;The merciful are shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful on the earth, and you will be shown mercy from above.&quot; (Sunan al-Tirmidhi).</blockquote><p name="f45e" id="f45e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">No matter how sinful or flawed we may be, all we need to do is ask for Allah’s forgiveness, and He will take us back with open arms. This divine act of mercy is a deep example of how we should treat others in our lives. If we could learn to forgive more readily, our relationships would be more resilient.</p><p name="a1fe" id="a1fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Forgiveness allows us to move beyond hurt and disappointment. In human relationships, mistakes are inevitable, but mercy and forgiveness are the foundations upon which lasting connections are built.</p></div></div></section><section name="f6a4" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="40c4" id="40c4" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">In the end, love, as we experience it, may always have its conditions and limitations. But through mercy and forgiveness, we can rise above the transactional nature of human relationships. Imagine that each relationship is a delicate bird, held aloft by two wings—one wing is mercy, and the other is forgiveness. Without both, the bird cannot fly. Without both, relationships will inevitably fall apart.</p><p name="7c79" id="7c79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps it is not love that sustains us but the mercy that we extend to one another. In a world where human love is conditional, transactional, and ever-changing, it is the divine essence of mercy that allows us to transcend our imperfections and find peace in our relationships.</p><p name="49cd" id="49cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">After all, in the end, we are all simply seeking to return to a love that is infinite, unconditional, and divine.</em></p></div></div></section>
