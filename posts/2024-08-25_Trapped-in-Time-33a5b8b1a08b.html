And the one after that? If they continued to stay together in each life, what would become of them?</p><p name="eb9a" id="eb9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This question haunted him because his existence was not like hers. His life was an endless cycle, a loop in which he would live, die, and then awaken once more at the age of eighteen, forced to relive the same years over and over. Each time, he would meet her again, and each time, he would fall in love with her all over again.</p><p name="1485" id="1485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason for considering this issue is precisely because his morality has not yet collapsed, and his concept of time has not completely changed.</p><p name="8c4b" id="8c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And most importantly,</p><p name="57f0" id="57f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is, if he is really together with her, then he truly wants to still have this relationship in the next life.</p><p name="8919" id="8919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But,</p><p name="e75c" id="e75c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He really had no confidence that he could be with her for &#39;life after life.&#39;</p><p name="93a4" id="93a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even if he could make that choice now, what about in the future? Was he still the same person he was in his first life?</p><p name="26de" id="26de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just say now, how similar is he now to who he was in the first life?</p><p name="d463" id="d463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even, continue to think about it,</p><p name="f5d0" id="f5d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You will find that this issue has nothing to do with morality and loyalty to feelings,</p><p name="4676" id="4676" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But an abyss—if he and she were together for a hundred lifetimes, what kind of state would she be in his eyes?</p><p name="2ce6" id="2ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">All her thoughts, actions, and words would become transparent to him... like a complex machine repeating predetermined processes and results.</p></div></div></section><section name="bb64" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="ec4d" id="ec4d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading">&quot;This is the problem...&quot;</blockquote><p name="bf28" id="bf28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">She recovered from her confusion.</p><p name="efcc" id="efcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His words were a response to her love.</p><p name="0102" id="0102" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She smiled, but still thought seriously and answered his somewhat strange question.</p><blockquote name="2ddb" id="2ddb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">&quot;If we have another life, that’s not something you need to worry about,&quot; she said. &quot;In my next life, I’ll make you fall in love with me all over again.&quot;</blockquote><blockquote name="4af6" id="4af6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">&quot;But what if I’m a bastard in my next life?&quot; he asked.</blockquote><blockquote name="a78e" id="a78e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">&quot;Have you ever heard of male and female evil spirits?&quot; she teased, raising her eyebrows playfully.</blockquote><p name="2ded" id="2ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">He couldn&#39;t help but laugh after hearing this.</p><p name="8bb1" id="8bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He made any answer for her in the next life.</p><p name="891c" id="891c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But... he still fell in love with her in the next life.</p><p name="e0f2" id="e0f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, he had done it many times.</p><p name="402c" id="402c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When ‘restarting’ and ‘reading files’ for the same life goal,</p><p name="8b5d" id="8b5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He may have been suffering from this long process of &#39;reading files&#39;, but during the time he spent with her, he never got tired of it.</p><p name="02d2" id="02d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He stretched out his hand and hugged her.</p><p name="d9f8" id="d9f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She just kept quiet and hugged him,</p><blockquote name="0ee6" id="0ee6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">&quot;...If in the next life, there is a little girl who looks like you, has the same personality as you, and is also named as you, she says she likes me, but she is not you, what should I do?&quot; He asked softly.</blockquote><blockquote name="e242" id="e242" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">She whispered, &quot;Then she is me.&quot;</blockquote></div></div></section>
